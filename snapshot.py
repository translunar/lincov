"""This script uses an existing linear covariance analysis as
input. Suppose you have covariances saved at 0, 600, 1200, and 1800
seconds (mission elapsed time), but you want one at 300 seconds. You
can run this script with the arguments 'label 300 three_hundred' and
it will generate a time, covariance, and metadata snapshot named
three_hundred.

Probably you want to do something like this:

  ./start.py my_lincov f9 init

which will start the analysis named 'my_lincov' from an analysis named
'f9' that has a snapshot called 'init'. When that's finished,

  ./snapshot.py my_lincov 360021.0 loi mission -5400

to create a snapshot of the covariance at LOI.

The only thing you can't really do with this script is to create a
snapshot a few seconds after another snapshot. For that you'd need to
write a custom script that combines start.py with snapshot.py.
